1.line(x, height-10, x+random(-10, 10), height-10-random(h));
2.if (random(100) > 99.9) {
    fill(255);
    rect(0, 0, width, height-15);
    h = 10;
3.h variable means the height of grass
4.it means height is a random number ranging from h-10 to h+10, it allows each height of grass to be different,some could be shorter than the one before

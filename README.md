# hw3
1.line(x, height-10, x+random(-10, 10), height-10-random(h));
2. if (x > width) {
    x = random(10);
    h = h + 3;
3.h variable means the height of grass
4.it means height is a random number ranging from h-10 to h+10, it allows each height of grass to be different,some could be shorter than the one before
